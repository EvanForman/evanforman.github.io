	<h4 id="Report">Report</h4>
	<p>This is a high-level critique of the piece best suited for early drafts. Though I aim to be as thorough and in-depth as possible, this isn't the granular work you'll get from my annotations; what I want to produce here is an actionable list of recommendations saying no, you're not crazy, yes, this is worth pursuing, okay, here’s everything you need for a great next draft.</p>

	<h4 id="Annotation">Annotation</h4>
	<p>This is a mixture of traditional line editing and a sentence-by-sentence guided tour of the piece: pointing out the stuff that really works, enhancing that where we can, suggesting tweaks at the level of the line or paragraph which will improve the structure as a whole. Traditionally this is work to be done on later drafts, but my annotations are more holistic than strict line editing so this would be a very comprehensive treatment for an early draft; consider this if you’re looking for a quick turnaround on the final draft.</p>

	<h4 id="Report + Annotation">Report + Annotation</h4>
	<p>Here's the package deal. I can send you the report and an annotated manuscript at the same time—this is how we beat the deadline—or I can give you the report on your first draft and annotate another whenever you’re ready, going in with a much deeper understanding of the relationship between you and the work and what you want to achieve with it.</p>

	<h4 id="Copyediting">Copyediting</h4>
	<p>I am not a copyeditor and I do not do copyediting, but I'll point out anything I see in the annotations and I know plenty of great proofreaders I can pass your work to. As we reach the victory lap we can discuss your budget for this and see who we can get on side.</p>
